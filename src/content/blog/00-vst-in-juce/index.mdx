TODO:: REMOVE COMMENT SECTIONS?


## Who? 
Me!

## What?
This blog! This is a space for me to record thoughts/questions/progress/etc.
related to music, coding, life, and whatever else I feel like! While I'm still 
getting started I'm going to focus on music production & VST development.

## When?
Once a week! new posts online by Sunday @ 11:59 PM EST.

## Where?
mwcm.ca/blog

## Why?
I've been making music on the computer in my free time for about eight years
now, I don't have much formal music education, but I'm learning and enjoying
the process every day! Last year I started posting some little sample based
beats and song ideas online at [SOUNDCLOUD LINK]. Seeing a handful of people
from across the globe listen to these releases has been a super rewarding 
experience!

My own: satisfaction, release, creative expression and enjoyment have been the
priorities so far. To that end, I've spent probably 95% of my music making time
playing around and experimenting vs. 5% studying or learning best practices
and techniques. 

This has been great so far! I was able to focus on the aspects of production 
which I gravitated to, and learn a decent amount about them, without:
	- sacrificing my love or enjoyment of music
	-	being paralyzed by self criticism or comparisons too often
	- turning my hobby into something that feels like work

But, now that I've been at it for a while, I'm noticing (more than ever) the
myriad ways in which the songs I'm making often do not sound as professional
(i.e. good, musical, complex, listenable, enjoyable, interesting) as many songs
I admire. 

Now, you may be tempted to say: "Morgan, if you had done X or Y over the PAST
8 years, you coulda been in A or B position - WITH knowledge C or D, TODAY!"

To which I would reply: "You're right!" I fully ackknowledge that my path
so far has not been very efficient. That being said, I'm now doing my best
to make up for lost time! If you have any other advice to help me on my journey
from here on out, please [GET IN TOUCH].

So, in order to keep growing as an artist, I've decided to be more intentional
about learning new skills and improving current ones, especially in areas I 
struggle with. When you see this next section you may say "Morgan, if these are
all the aspects of music making you feel bad at, what do you feel good at?".
I would say

The areas/concepts/processes in music making that I believe
I struggle with most are:

	- 1. composition (theory, melody, harmony, structure, instrumentation, voicing, variety, musical complexity)
				- I have never spent much time learning how to write music for any
					instrument! I'm a mediocre drummer and a self taught guitar player.
					It would be generous to say that I have a basic understanding of music theory.
				- deciding which notes a given instrument will play and when
					(writing music in general) is a struggle
						- note: relatively confident writing chord progressions though 
				- my written melody parts are often extremely simple/boring
				- extremely limited understanding of harmony
				- being more intentional/informed about which instrument I use for which
					part and understanding the conotations/implications of different instruments
				- I have never been very intentional about song structure, usually let
					projects come together gradually without much planning.
						- how should this song be structured to acheive a given aim
				- not enough subtle variation over the course of a song 
	- 2. managing loudness (clarity, dynamics, energy level)
				- gain staging? never heard of it
				- vague understanding of how to use compressors, limiters,
					other plugins meant for controlling volume or relative volume
					of sonic elements
				- avoiding muddy sounding parts and freq ranges
				- lufs vs dbfs?
				- this *could* go under polish too I suppose? but seems essential enough
					to be it's own section
	- 3. polish (effects, transitions, best practices, sound design)
				- understanding how a specific effect functions well enough to use it without
					presets or too much experimentation, understanding relevant best practices
					and why they are best practices 
				- knowledge of which effects can be used to solve a given problem, achieve a
					specific sound, complement another element, etc.. and how to go about it
				- how to go about creating interesting/different sounds
				- finding creative ways to transition between sections, not overusing
					them

## How?

### improving composiiton
	- talk about composition lessons
	- talk about being intentional about using less samples/more selfwritten parts
			- in a way that adds to the fun, not detracts from it
	- talk about being more intentional about planning song structure 
			- in a way that adds to the fun, not detracts from it
	- talk about being more intentional about planning instrumentation
			- in a way that adds to the fun, not detracts from it
	- how the processes of Composition, Arrangement, Sound Design, Mixing,
		Mastering (lite), influence eachother and become one process
	- talk about writing songs w band

### improving loudness & polish 
- talk about electronic music class at carleton
- talk about steve duda video
- talk about pitcher a tiny bit
- talk about how VST building will help
- talk about why vst building vs max vs puredata etc
- talk about how why not just watch tutorials on youtube or ask chatgpt
- anything else to add?

### WHY A BLOG?
	- keep me honest
	- write a little bit every day, at least once a week
	- share learning experience, maybe helpful to others
	- maybe will end up writing about more topics afterwards
	- anything else?
