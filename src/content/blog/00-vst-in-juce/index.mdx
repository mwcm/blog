## Who? 
Me - Morgan

## What?
This blog! This is a space for me to record thoughts/questions/progress/etc.
related to music, coding, life, and whatever else I feel like! While I'm still 
getting started I'm going to focus on music production & VST development.

## When?
Once a week, new posts online by Sunday @ 11:59 PM EST.

## Where?
mwcm.ca/blog

## Why?
I've been making music on the computer in my free time for about eight years
now, I don't have much formal music education, but I'm learning and enjoying
the process every day! Last year I started posting some little sample based
beats and song ideas online at [SOUNDCLOUD LINK]. Seeing a handful of people
from across the globe listen to these releases has been a super rewarding 
experience!

My own: satisfaction, release, creative expression and enjoyment have been the
priorities so far. To that end, I've spent probably 95% of my music making time
playing around and experimenting vs. 5% studying or learning best practices
and techniques. 

This has been great so far, I was able to focus on the aspects of production 
which I gravitated to, and learn a decent amount about them, without:
	- sacrificing my love or enjoyment of music
	-	being paralyzed by self criticism or comparisons too often
	- turning my hobby into something that feels like work

But, now that I've been at it for a while, I'm noticing (more than ever) the
myriad ways in which the songs I'm making often do not sound as professional
(i.e. good, musical, complex, listenable, enjoyable, interesting) as many songs
I admire. 

//////// edit this bit
Now, you may be tempted to say: "Morgan, if you had done X or Y over the PAST
8 years, you coulda been in A or B position - WITH knowledge C or D, TODAY!"

To which I would reply: "You're right!" I fully ackknowledge that my path
until now has not been very efficient. That being said, I'm now doing my best
to make up for lost time! If you have any other advice to help me on my journey
from here on out, please [GET IN TOUCH].

So, in order to keep growing as an artist, I've decided to be more intentional
about learning new skills and improving current ones, especially in areas I 
struggle with. When you see this next section you may say "Morgan, if these are
all the aspects of music making you feel bad at, what do you feel good at?".
I would say rhythm, layering, texture and sampling. Precious little in
comparison, but it's a starting point at least.
/////////

The areas/concepts/processes in music making that I believe
I struggle with most are:

	- 1. composition in general ( understanding of: theory, melody, harmony, structure, 
		instrumentation, voicing, variety, musical complexity)

				- I have never spent much time learning how to write music for any
					instrument! I'm a mediocre drummer and a self taught guitar player.
					It would be generous to say that I have a basic understanding of music theory.

				- I have never been very intentional about song structure, usually let
					projects come together gradually without much planning.
						- how should this song be structured to acheive a given aim

				- deciding which notes a given instrument will play and when
					(writing music in general) is a struggle
						- note: relatively confident writing chord progressions, though my
								experience is mostly based on playing guitar and finding progressions
								that sound nice to my ear

				- not enough subtle variation over the course of a song 

				- my written melody parts are often extremely simple/boring

				- often don't take advantage of space/silence enough

				- EXTREMELY limited understanding of harmony

				- could be more intentional/informed about which instrument I use for which part

				- could use an education on the historical functions/conotations/implications of different instruments


	- 2. managing loudness (clarity, dynamics, energy level)

				- gain staging? never heard of it

				- vague understanding of how to use compressors, limiters, saturation
					other plugins meant for controlling volume or relative volume
					of sonic elements

				- avoiding muddy sounding parts and freq ranges

				- lufs vs dbfs?

				- it could be argued that this section could fit under either
					composition, or polish, but I think it's important enough to warrant
					it's own dedicated section


	- 3. polish (effects, transitions, best practices, sound design)

				- understanding how a specific effect functions well enough to use it without
					presets or too much experimentation, understanding relevant best practices
					and why they are best practices 

				- knowledge of which effects can be used to solve a given problem, achieve a
					specific sound, compliment another element, etc.. and how to go about it

				- finding creative ways to transition between sections, not overusing
					or overusing individual transitions

				- how to go about creating interesting/different sounds
						- could be argued that this falls under composition instead,
								sound design can be very central to composition, but it can also
								be addressed after the broad strokes of a piece are defined,
								which is usually how I work

## How?

### improving composiiton

	- started taking weekly composition/production lessons with a formally
			educated and experienced producer
				- this has already been a major help and has led me to creating some
					pieces I never would have even approached otherwise

	- I'm going to try to be more intentional about using fewer samples and more
			self written/recorded parts in my compositions, at least until I'm feeling
			more at ease writing my own material
				- this has already been going well, even just in the past few weeks, 
					extremely rewarding!
				- one caveat: the ocasional interpolation is fine, just don't overuse
					them, the main point of this is learning to write music

	- I'm also going to be more intentional about planning and song structure,
			specifically not spending too much time in the "eight bar loop" stage of
			production that can be easy to get stuck in, and rather starting to think
			in terms of verses/choruses/transitions/etc. as soon as a basic idea is 
			fleshed out, even if all that means is coming up with a rough outline
			early, that will be a big improvement on my current process

// TODO below here

	- talk about being more intentional about planning instrumentation
			- in a way that adds to the fun, not detracts from it

	- how the processes of Composition, Arrangement, Sound Design, Mixing,
		Mastering (lite), influence eachother and become one process
	- talk about writing songs w band
	- talk abut practicing making things in ableton on my own

### improving loudness & polish 
- talk about electronic music class at carleton
- talk about steve duda video
- talk about pitcher a tiny bit
- talk about how VST building will help
- talk about why vst building vs max vs puredata etc
- talk about how why not just watch tutorials on youtube or ask chatgpt
- mention composition lessons again since they def. touch on these topics 
- mention practicing making things in ableton

### WHY A BLOG?
	- keep me honest
	- write a little bit every day, at least once a week
	- share learning experience, maybe helpful to others
	- maybe will end up writing about more topics afterwards
	- anything else?
